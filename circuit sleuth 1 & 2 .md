circuit 1
  we have to close the gate 1-8 in desired order for the led to turn on
  the circuit consists of gates that feed input for series of 'not' and 'and' gates
  input from the gates go to and gate and there are only 3 not gates
  using the knowlegde of the not & and logic gate the answer is gates 1 4 5 6 7

circuit 2
  here the gates 1-10 are closed and we have to open them in their desired oredr for the led to turn on
  here inputs goes through a series of not gates and then through a series of and gates
  using the knowlegde of the not & and logic gate the answer is gates 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10
