the given photo depicts the expanded for of the basic logic gates and or xor etc
we have to assign 1 or 0 to w x y & z to power/ON o1 o2 o3 o4 o5
the answer is 0110
now we have to encrypt it using SHA256 hash
the flag is this encryption
this can also be cracked using brut forse ie...there are only 16 possible combination 
by taking educated guesse one can narrow it down to 4 or 5 combination and can easily find the correct code.
